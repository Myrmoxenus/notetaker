## Description:
Completed as a homework assignment for Washington University's Fullstack Web Development Program. The purpose of the application was to develop the back end for a note taking application to help become familiar with express.js. The front end was prepared by the program. The application can be used to compose, save, and delete notes. Notes are stored in a JSON file.

[Application deployed here via Heroku!](https://warm-anchorage-12496.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage:
Press the "Get Started" button to access the notes page. On the notes page, you can type in the boxes for Note Title and Note Text. Once a title and text has been entered, a save icon appears in the upper right corner which allows you to save notes. Saved notes are displayed and can be selected from the leftmost column of the application. The trash icon deletes notes.
